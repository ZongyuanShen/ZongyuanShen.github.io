I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/) at [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/), advised by Professor [Shalabh Gupta](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shalabh-gupta/) and co-advised by Professor [Shengli Zhou](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shengli-zhou/) and Professor [Liang Zhang](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/liang-zhang/). I did my masters in the same lab on the area of [3D Coverage Path Planning](https://digitalcommons.lib.uconn.edu/gs_theses/1133/). Prior to University of Connecticut, I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Heilongjiang University of Science and Technology in China in 2014. I am passionate about developing motion and path planning algorithms that allow the robots to perform various tasks safely in complex, dynamic, and unknown environments. In particular, my current research involves two topics:

- **Motion Replanning:** generates new paths in response to the changes in the environment using current obstacle information (reactive strategy) or predicted trajectory of moving obstacles (proactive strategy) for uninterrupted safe navigation in dynamic and/or unknown environments.
- **Coverage Path Planning:** generates paths to visit all points in an area of interest and perform tasks such as environment monitoring, seabed mapping, and structure inspection in unknown environments.
