I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/) at [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/), advised by Professor [Shalabh Gupta](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shalabh-gupta/) and co-advised by Professor [Shengli Zhou](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shengli-zhou/) and Professor [Liang Zhang](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/liang-zhang/). My research is centered around coverage path planning and motion planning in dynamic environments.

Prior to University of Connecticut, I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Heilongjiang University of Science and Technology in China in 2014.
