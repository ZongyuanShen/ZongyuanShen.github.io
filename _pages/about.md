I am an incoming postdoctoral fellow of Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Connecticut in 2024, advised by Professor [Shalabh Gupta](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shalabh-gupta/) and co-advised by Professor [Shengli Zhou](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shengli-zhou/) and Professor [Liang Zhang](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/liang-zhang/). I earned my M.S. degree from University of Connecticut in 2017. I received my B.E. degree from Heilongjiang University of Science and Technology in China in 2014. 

I am passionate about developing motion and path planning algorithms that allow the robots to perform various tasks safely in complex, dynamic, and unknown environments. In particular, my current research involves two topics:

- **Motion Planning in Dynamic Environments:** plan a new path in response to the changes in the environment (e.g., obstacles appear, disappear, or move) using current information (reactive strategy) or predicted information of dynamic obstacles (proactive strategy) for uninterrupted safe navigation.
- **Coverage Path Planning in Unknown Environments:** plan a path to enable a robot to cover all points in the area of interest to provide complete coverage and minimize the coverage time.
