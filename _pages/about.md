I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/) at [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/), advised by Professor [Shalabh Gupta](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shalabh-gupta/) and co-advised by Professor [Shengli Zhou](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shengli-zhou/) and Professor [Liang Zhang](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/liang-zhang/). My current research focuses on:

1. **Online coverage path planning:** How to plan an efficient path for autonomous robots to completely cover an unknown area of interest while ensuring computational efficiency, constrained capability of robot, and high path quality.
2. **Reactive replanning:** How to facilitate fast and efficient replanning in response to changes in the environment, where these changes can not be predicted, but can be observed after they occur using on-board sensors.
3. **Active replanning:** How to model the behavior of dynamic obstacles, predict their futures states, and integrate these information into the active replanning algorithm for time-risk optimal navigation.

I did my masters under the guidance of Professor [Shalabh Gupta](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shalabh-gupta/) also on the area of 3D coverage path planning for seabed mapping. Prior to University of Connecticut, I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Heilongjiang University of Science and Technology in China in 2014.
