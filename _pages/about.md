I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/) at [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/), advised by Professor [Shalabh Gupta](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shalabh-gupta/) and co-advised by Professor [Shengli Zhou](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shengli-zhou/) and Professor [Liang Zhang](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/liang-zhang/). My current research focuses on:

1. How to design a sensor-based coverage path planning algorithm that is computationally efficient, guarantees complete coverage, and achieves low coverage time, less number of turns and overlappings.
2. How to facilitate fast and efficient replanning in response to changes in the environment with obstacles that unpredictably appear, move, and vanish.
3. How to model the behavior of dynamic obstacles, predict their futures states, and integrate these information into the active replanning algorithm for time-risk optimal navigation.

Prior to University of Connecticut, I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Heilongjiang University of Science and Technology in China in 2014.
