I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/) at [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/), advised by Professor [Shalabh Gupta](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shalabh-gupta/) and co-advised by Professor [Shengli Zhou](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shengli-zhou/) and Professor [Liang Zhang](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/liang-zhang/). My research is foused on

1. How to design a sensor-based coverage path planning algorithm that is computationally efficient, guarantees complete coverage, and achieves low coverage time, less number of turns and overlappings.
2. How to efficiently and rapidly replan in response to the latest environmental changes to achieve low collision rate and travel time.
3. How to model the behavior of dynamic obstacles and predict their futures states and then integrate these information into the active replanning algorithm to compute a time-risk optimal path in the spatio-temporal domain.

Prior to University of Connecticut, I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Heilongjiang University of Science and Technology in China in 2014.
