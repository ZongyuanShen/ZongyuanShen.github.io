I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/) at [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/), advised by Professor [Shalabh Gupta](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shalabh-gupta/) and co-advised by Professor [Shengli Zhou](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shengli-zhou/) and Professor [Liang Zhang](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/liang-zhang/). My current research focuses on:

1. **Online Coverage Path Planning:** How to plan an efficient path to completely cover an unknown area of interest while ensuring computational efficiency, and satisfying robot constraints (e.g., curvature and energy) and high path quality (e.g., length, number of turns, and overlappings).
2. **Reactive Path Replanning:** How to facilitate fast and efficient replanning in response to changes in the environment using the most recently obervations.
3. **Active Path Replanning:** How to predict the futures states of dynamic obstacles and exploit these information to enhance robot's safety while ensuring low travel time.

I did my masters under the guidance of Professor [Shalabh Gupta](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shalabh-gupta/) also on the area of [3D underwater terrain mapping](https://digitalcommons.lib.uconn.edu/gs_theses/1133/). Prior to University of Connecticut, I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Heilongjiang University of Science and Technology in China in 2014.
