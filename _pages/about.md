I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/) at [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/), advised by Professor [Shalabh Gupta](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shalabh-gupta/) and co-advised by Professor [Shengli Zhou](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shengli-zhou/) and Professor [Liang Zhang](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/liang-zhang/). My current research focuses on:

1. **Online Coverage Path Planning:** How to plan an efficient path to completely cover an unknown environment while ensuring computational and memory efficiency, and satisfying robot constraints (e.g., curvature and energy) and high path quality (e.g., path length, number of turns, and overlappings).
2. **Reactive Motion Replanning:** How to facilitate fast and efficient replanning in response to changes in the environment (e.g., obstacles appear, disappear, or move) using the most recently observations.
3. **Active Motion Replanning:** How to predict trajectories of moving obstacles and generate a new plan which can actively avoid collision to the moving obstacles in the future and guarantee the possible lowest travel time to the goal.

I did my masters under the guidance of Professor [Shalabh Gupta](https://www.ee.uconn.edu/shalabh-gupta/) also on the area of [3D underwater terrain mapping](https://digitalcommons.lib.uconn.edu/gs_theses/1133/). Prior to University of Connecticut, I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Heilongjiang University of Science and Technology in China in 2014.
