I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Connecticut, advised by Professor Shalabh Gupta and co-advised by Professor Shengli Zhou and Professor Liang Zhang. My research is centered around coverage path planning and motion planning in dynamic environments.

Prior to University of Connecticut, I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Heilongjiang University of Science and Technology in China in 2014.
