abstract={This paper presents an algorithm, called Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree (SMART), that facilitates fast replanning in dynamic environments. SMART performs risk-based tree-pruning if the current path is obstructed by nearby moving obstacle(s), resulting in multiple disjoint subtrees. Then, for speedy recovery, it exploits these subtrees and performs informed tree-repair at hot-spots that lie at the intersection of subtrees to find a new path. The performance of SMART is comparatively evaluated with eight existing algorithms through extensive simulations. Two scenarios are considered with: 1) dynamic obstacles and 2) both static and dynamic obstacles. The results show that SMART yields significant improvements in replanning time, success rate, and travel time. Finally, the performance of SMART is validated by a real laboratory experiment.},

abstract={This paper addresses the 3D coverage path planning (CPP) problem for terrain reconstruction of unknown obstacle-rich environments. Due to sensing limitations, the proposed method, called CT-CPP, performs layered scanning of the 3D region to collect terrain data, where the traveling sequence is optimized using the concept of a coverage tree (CT) with a TSP-inspired tree traversal strategy. The CT-CPP method is validated on a high-fidelity underwater simulator and the results are compared to an existing terrain following CPP method. The results show that CT-CPP yields significant reduction in trajectory length, energy consumption, and reconstruction error.},

abstract={With the onset and rapid growth of smart manufacturing, there is a constant increase in the demand for automation technologies to enhance productivity while providing uninterrupted, cost-efficient, and resilient machining. Traditional manufacturing systems, however, suffer from several losses due to machine faults and degradation. Specifically, tool wear directly impacts the precision and quality of the milled parts, which causes an increase in the scrap production. Hence, more attempts are required to meet the desired quota of successful parts, which in turn results in wasted material, longer delays, further tool degradation, and higher energy, machining, and labor costs. As such, this paper develops a multi-objective optimization framework to generate the optimal control set points (e.g., feed rate and width of cut) that minimize the total cost of machining operations resulting from multiple contradictory cost functions (e.g., material, energy, tardiness, machining, labor, and tool) in the presence of tool wear. Notably, we estimate the total expected cost in dollars, which provides automatic and intuitive weighting in this multi-objective formulation. The optimization framework is tested on a high-fidelity face milling model that has been validated on real data from industry. Results show significant dollar savings of up to 
15% as compared to the default control scheme.},
